        <h5>Odissi<span>  .</span></h5>
          <p>Odissi (Odia:, also referred to as Orissi in old literature, is a major ancient Indian classical dance that originated in the temples of Odisha â€“ an eastern coastal state of India.[1][2][3] Odissi, in its history, was performed predominantly by women,[1][4] and expressed religious stories and spirital ideas, particularly of Vaishnavism through songs written and composed according to the ragas & talas of Odissi music by ancient poets of the state. Odissi performances have also expressed ideas of other traditions such as those related to Hindu Gods Shiva and Surya, as well as Hindu Goddesses (Shaktism)</p>
